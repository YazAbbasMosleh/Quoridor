# Quoridor Auto-Player (Back-End) using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

This project aims to develop an auto-player for the **Quoridor** board game using the **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm. The project serves as the final project for the **Advanced Programming** course at **Amirkabir University of Technology**.

## Project Overview

**Quoridor** is a two-player strategy board game where players take turns to either move their pawn or place a wall to block the opponentâ€™s movement. The goal is to be the first to reach the opponent's side of the board.

In this project, we developed an auto-player for the Quoridor game using the **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm. The AI can make optimal decisions by simulating potential future game states and choosing the most promising moves based on randomized simulations.

### Features:
- **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for decision-making.
- Simulates multiple game scenarios to find the best possible move.
- AI plays as one of the players in a Quoridor game, against either another AI or a human.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YazAbbasMosleh/Quoridor.git
